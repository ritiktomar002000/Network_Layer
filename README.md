# 🧠 Dog vs Non-Dog Image Classification using Neural Network with Hidden Layers

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a fully connected neural network with one or more hidden layers from scratch using NumPy to classify images as dog or non-dog.

The objective is to gain a deep understanding of forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient-based optimization without using high-level deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
